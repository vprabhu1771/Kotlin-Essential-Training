In Kotlin, you can list the files and subdirectories in a directory using the `listFiles()` function provided by the `java.io.File` class. This function returns an array of `File` objects representing the files and directories in the specified directory. Here's an example of how to list the files and subdirectories in a directory:

```kotlin
import java.io.File

fun main() {
    val directoryPath = "my_directory"

    try {
        val directory = File(directoryPath)

        if (directory.exists() && directory.isDirectory) {
            val filesAndDirectories = directory.listFiles()

            if (filesAndDirectories != null) {
                for (file in filesAndDirectories) {
                    if (file.isDirectory) {
                        println("Directory: ${file.name}")
                    } else {
                        println("File: ${file.name}")
                    }
                }
            } else {
                println("The directory is empty.")
            }
        } else {
            println("The specified path is not a valid directory.")
        }
    } catch (e: Exception) {
        println("Error listing files and directories: ${e.message}")
    }
}
```

In this example:

1. We specify the directory path as `"my_directory"`. Make sure to replace it with the path to the directory you want to list the files and subdirectories of.

2. We use a `try-catch` block to handle any potential exceptions that might occur during directory listing.

3. We create a `File` object representing the specified directory.

4. We check if the directory exists and if it is indeed a directory using the `exists()` and `isDirectory` properties of the `File` object.

5. If the directory exists and is a valid directory, we use the `listFiles()` function to obtain an array of `File` objects representing the files and subdirectories in the directory.

6. We loop through the array and check if each `File` object represents a directory or a file. Depending on the type, we print the name of the directory or file.

7. If the `listFiles()` function returns `null`, it means the directory is empty.

Remember that the directory path is relative to the current working directory of your Kotlin program. If you want to specify an absolute path, make sure to provide the full path (e.g., `"C:/my_directory"`, `"/home/user/my_directory"`, etc.). Also, handle exceptions gracefully to ensure your program behaves well in case of any issues during directory listing.
