Sure! Buffered streams can significantly improve performance when working with files by reducing the number of I/O operations and minimizing the overhead associated with reading and writing data. Here's an example of how to use buffered streams for improved performance when copying a large binary file:

```kotlin
import java.io.*

fun main() {
    val sourceFileName = "large_source.bin"
    val destinationFileName = "large_destination.bin"

    try {
        val sourceFile = File(sourceFileName)
        val destinationFile = File(destinationFileName)

        val inputStream = BufferedInputStream(FileInputStream(sourceFile))
        val outputStream = BufferedOutputStream(FileOutputStream(destinationFile))

        val buffer = ByteArray(1024) // Adjust buffer size as needed
        var bytesRead: Int

        while (inputStream.read(buffer).also { bytesRead = it } != -1) {
            outputStream.write(buffer, 0, bytesRead)
        }

        inputStream.close()
        outputStream.close()

        println("Large file copied successfully from $sourceFileName to $destinationFileName.")
    } catch (e: IOException) {
        println("Error copying the file: ${e.message}")
    }
}
```

In this example:

1. We specify the name of the source file (`large_source.bin`) and the destination file (`large_destination.bin`) you want to copy the data to. Make sure the source file exists in the same directory as the Kotlin source file.

2. We use a `try-catch` block to handle any potential exceptions that might occur during file copying.

3. Inside the `try` block, we create `File` objects representing the source and destination files.

4. We create `BufferedInputStream` and `BufferedOutputStream` to read from the source file and write to the destination file, respectively.

5. We use a buffer of size 1024 bytes to read data from the source file in chunks. You can adjust the buffer size based on your requirements.

6. We use a `while` loop to read data from the source file in chunks using `inputStream.read(buffer)` and write the same data to the destination file using `outputStream.write(buffer, 0, bytesRead)`.

7. Finally, we close both the `inputStream` and `outputStream` to save the changes and release any system resources.

Using buffered streams in this example can significantly improve the file copying performance, especially when dealing with large files. It's because buffered streams read and write data in larger chunks, reducing the number of actual disk I/O operations and improving overall efficiency.
