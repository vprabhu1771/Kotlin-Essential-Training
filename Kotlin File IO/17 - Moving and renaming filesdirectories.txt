To move and rename files and directories in Kotlin, you can use the `java.io.File` class to represent the source and destination paths. For moving files or directories, you can use the `renameTo()` method of the `File` class. Here's an example of how to move and rename files and directories:

```kotlin
import java.io.File

fun main() {
    val sourceFilePath = "source_directory/file.txt"
    val destinationFilePath = "destination_directory/newfile.txt"

    val sourceDirectoryPath = "source_directory"
    val destinationDirectoryPath = "destination_directory/new_directory"

    try {
        // Move and rename a file
        val fileToMove = File(sourceFilePath)
        val destinationFile = File(destinationFilePath)

        if (fileToMove.exists()) {
            if (fileToMove.renameTo(destinationFile)) {
                println("File moved and renamed successfully.")
            } else {
                println("Failed to move and rename the file.")
            }
        } else {
            println("Source file does not exist.")
        }

        // Move and rename a directory
        val directoryToMove = File(sourceDirectoryPath)
        val destinationDirectory = File(destinationDirectoryPath)

        if (directoryToMove.exists() && directoryToMove.isDirectory) {
            if (directoryToMove.renameTo(destinationDirectory)) {
                println("Directory moved and renamed successfully.")
            } else {
                println("Failed to move and rename the directory.")
            }
        } else {
            println("Source directory does not exist.")
        }
    } catch (e: Exception) {
        println("Error moving and renaming files and directories: ${e.message}")
    }
}
```

In this example:

1. We specify the source file path (`source_directory/file.txt`) and the destination file path (`destination_directory/newfile.txt`) for the file movement and renaming.

2. We specify the source directory path (`source_directory`) and the destination directory path (`destination_directory/new_directory`) for the directory movement and renaming.

3. We use a `try-catch` block to handle any potential exceptions that might occur during the move and rename operations.

4. We use the `File` class to represent the source and destination paths.

5. For moving and renaming a file, we use the `renameTo()` method on the `File` object representing the file to move.

6. For moving and renaming a directory, we use the `renameTo()` method on the `File` object representing the directory to move.

7. After each move and rename operation, we check if the operation was successful and print the appropriate message.

Remember to handle exceptions gracefully to ensure your program behaves well in case of any issues during the move and rename operations. Also, ensure that the source file/directory exists and the destination file/directory does not exist before performing the move and rename operations.
